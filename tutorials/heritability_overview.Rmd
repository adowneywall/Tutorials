# Overview 

## Origins in quantitative genetics

Animal models are rooted in fundamental quantitative genetics, a discipline with a long and distinguished history within evolutionary biology and animal breeding. In particular, a simple QG framework developed for disentangling the factors that contribute to phenotypic traits, including heritable genetic (and more recently non-genetic) architecture (Falconer & Mackay 1996; Lynch & Walsh 1998). In it's simplest form this framework can be written as:

$$V_P = V_g + V_r$$
Where $V_P$ is the variance of the phenotype, $V_g$ is the genetic variation, and $V_r$ is the residual (sometime called environmental) variation. From this model is it possible to estimate the amount of phenotypic variation due to genes (or genetic variation).



In there simplest form, quantitative genetics aims to distinguish the sources 

## Expansion of linear mixed models 

 These studies
have typically used a form of mixed-effects models known as
the ‘animal model’ to decompose phenotypic variance into
different genetic and environmental sources and to estimate
key parameters such as the heritability of a trait or the genetic
correlations between traits (e.g. Réale, Festa-Bianchet & Jor-
genson 1999; Kruuk et al. 2000; Milner et al. 2000; Kruuk,
Merila & Sheldon 2001; Garant et al. 2004; Wilson et al.
2005; Gienapp, Postma & Visser 2006).
