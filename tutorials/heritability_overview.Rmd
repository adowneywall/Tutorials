# Overview 

## Origins in quantitative genetics

The original goal of quantitative genetics is to make inferences about inheritance, evolutionary potential, and the genetic basis of a phenotype without explicit knowledge of the actual genetic loci involved (Wilson et al. 2010). This is possible through careful documentation of the relationships among individuals, whereby pedigrees can be constructed. Using pedigree data, when individuals that are more closely related are also phenotypically more similar than unrelated individuals we can infer that phenotypic variance is, in large part, genetically driven. Animal models represent a (relatively recent) approach for examining the genetic basis for phenotypic variance, utilizing a linear mixed model framework.

In its simplest form, a single trait in a quantitative genetics framework can be written as:

$$V_P = V_G + V_R$$
Where $V_P$ is the variance of the phenotype, $V_G$ is the genetic variation, and $V_R$ is the residual (sometime called environmental) variation. From this model is it possible to estimate the amount of phenotypic variation due to genes (or genetic variation). Importantly, both sources of variation ($V_G$ and $V_R$) can be further partitioned. As an example, $V_G$ is frequently thought of has the combination of additive genetic variation ($V_A$), epistatic interactions ($V_{Ep}$), and dominance effects ($V_{D}$). Moreover, $V_R$ is really a catch-all for all phenotypic variance not explained by genetic variation. Some of this variance may be driven by environment, but other non-genetic effects (e.g., maternal or epigenetic) may also explain significant amounts of variation (more on this later).

## Animal model: just a linear mixed model 

Animal models are simply linear mixed models that (at a minimum) include pedigree or animal relatedness as a **random effect** in a linear mixed model. By fitting a simply linear mixed model with phenotype as the response variable and a relatedness (or animal) matrix as a random effect it is possible to decompose phenotypic variance into different genetic and environmental sources and to estimate key parameters such as the heritability of a trait or the genetic correlations between traits (e.g. RÃ©ale, Festa-Bianchet & Jorgenson 1999; Kruuk et al. 2000; Milner et al. 2000; Kruuk,Merila & Sheldon 2001; Garant et al. 2004; Wilson et al.2005; Gienapp, Postma & Visser 2006). The simplest model for this might look like:

$$P_i = \mu + g_i + r_i$$
Where $P_i$ is the phenotype for individual $i$, $\mu$ is the population mean for the population, $g_i$ and $r_i$ are the genetic and residual effects for individual $i$, respectively.

Beyond the simple model, animal models are extremely flexible. It is possible to add fixed effects to account for specific sources of variation in your data (e.g., sex or age).


## Calculating heritability (and porportional contribution of other effects on phenotypic variance)

There are two types of heritability, broad-sense and narrow-sense. Broad-sense heritability is the proportion of phenotypic variance due to genetic variance ($\frac{V_G}{V_P}$), while narrow-sense heritability is specifically the proportion of phenotypic variance that is due to additive genetic variance ($\frac{V_A}{V_P}$). The later is what is often the focus of most animal model and
